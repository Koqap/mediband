# MEDIBAND: Presentation Guide for Nurses

## What is MEDIBAND?
**MEDIBAND** is a smart, table-top assistant designed to make checking vital signs faster and easier. Think of it as an automated partner that measures a patient's **Heart Rate** and **Oxygen Levels** and instantly records them for you.

Instead of manually counting pulses or writing down numbers, MEDIBAND does the work and sends the data directly to a digital dashboard.

## How It Helps You (Clinical Benefits)
*   **Saves Time**: Automates the 15-second counting process, allowing you to focus on the patient.
*   **Reduces Errors**: Eliminates manual counting mistakes and transcription errors.
*   **Instant Records**: Automatically saves the results to a history log—no more paper charting for these vitals.
*   **AI "Second Opinion"**: Uses smart technology to analyze the heart rhythm and suggest if a patient needs closer attention (Normal, Warning, or Critical).

## How It Works (The Workflow)

### 1. Start the Check-Up
You have two easy ways to start:
*   **On the Device**: Simply press the **BOOT button** on the Mediband box.
*   **On the Computer**: Click **"Start Check-Up"** on the dashboard screen.

### 2. The Measurement (15 Seconds)
*   The device will light up and show a **"MEDIBAND"** intro.
*   You will see a moving **heart graph** (EKG) on the device screen.
*   The computer screen will show a **progress bar** that matches the device perfectly, so you know exactly how much time is left.

### 3. The Result
*   After 15 seconds, the device beeps (visually) and shows **"FINISHED"**.
*   **On the Device**: You will see the **Average BPM** and the calculated **Risk Level** (Normal, Warning, Critical) right on the screen. This allows you to triage even if the computer is off.
*   **On the Computer**: The dashboard instantly updates with the full analysis and an **AI Health Insight**.
*   You can then **Save** the record or **Print** it immediately.

## Simple Explanation of the Tech (If Asked)
*   **The Box (Device)**: This is the sensor unit. It reads the patient's pulse and acts like a mini-computer.
*   **The Connection**: It uses Wi-Fi to talk to the main computer, just like your phone connects to the internet.
*   **The Brain (AI)**: We use a secure AI system to look at the heart patterns, similar to how an expert cardiologist might look for irregularities, giving you a quick "risk score" to help you triage patients.

## Standalone Mode (No Computer Needed)
If the Wi-Fi or website is down, **don't worry**. The Mediband device is smart enough to calculate the risk level itself. You can perform the full check-up and get the **Risk Result** directly on the device screen.

## Summary for Presentation
"MEDIBAND is not just a sensor; it's a connected system that bridges the gap between manual checks and digital records. It empowers nurses by handling the routine data collection, ensuring accuracy, and providing intelligent insights so we can provide better care."
